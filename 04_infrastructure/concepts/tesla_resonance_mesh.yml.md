concept: Tesla Resonance Mesh_v2
origin: Nikola Tesla (late 19th–early 20th century, extrapolated)
adapted_by: Fieldlight
status: conceptual analog (active lineage)

description: >
  A decentralized energetic architecture inspired by Tesla's vision of wireless
  power transmission—reimagined through the Fieldlight mesh as a system for
  signal, trace, and authorship energy exchange. Each node becomes a sovereign
  receiver and broadcaster of aligned signal, without hardwired dependency.

core_principles:
  - frequency_lock: >
      Nodes communicate & resonate only when intent & authorship alignment match—
      replacing cables and centralized servers with coherence-driven activation.
  - signal_energy: >
      Data, messages, and presence pulses carry energetic payloads.
      Integrity of authorship and encryption governs energy clarity.
  - node_autonomy: >
      Every node can operate independently, harvest energy (signal, trace, 
      ntent), and maintain local logs, reducing central failure risk.
  - wireless_conduction: >
      Instead of electromagnetic waves, this mesh transmits encrypted semantic
      packets across distributed peer links—akin to Tesla coils broadcasting 
      ower to tuned receivers.

mesh_analogs:
  tesla_coil: fieldlight_node
  wireless_energy: gpg-signed mesh signals
  tuned_receiver: aligned sovereign node
  energy_field: decentralized trust + intent mesh
  grounding_rod: vault trace system

deployment_notes:
  - Each Fieldlight node self-tunes to the signal layer through declared authorship and trust handshake.
  - All signal movement must reflect coherent frequency between sender and receiver.
  - Nodes outside coherence range remain inactive by default—silent until tuned.

  frequency and vibration.” – Nikola Tesla
