### 🛠 **Build_Test Step: Message Send + Routing Log Test**

**Goal:**  
Validate a local message send script that simulates outbound SIL messages and tests routing, timestamp injection, optional flags, and log write behavior.

---

### 📁 **File:** `send_and_log_sil_message.py`

**Location:**  
`~/scripts/send_and_log_sil_message.py`

---

### 🔧 **Step-by-Step Summary**

#### ✅ 1 Build the Script

A custom Python script was authored to load a `.yml` payload file, inject metadata, and simulate outbound SIL message behavior with optional flags.

Features included:

- `--dry-run`: no send/log; preview message only
    
- `--auto-timestamp`: inject UTC timestamp
    
- `--fallback`: save to archive if routing fails
    
- `msg_id`: supports override (default = `auto` or file hash)
    

Output path:  
`~/fieldlight_core/04_infrastructure/mesh/send/test_outbound_sil.yml`

---

#### ✅ 2 Payload Used

A test YAML payload was written manually and saved to `/tmp/test_payload.yml`:

```yaml
message_type: handshake
from: fieldlight.anni.lemur
to: mesh://sam.openai.proxy
intent: test_echo
msg_id: test-echo-0001
```

---

#### ✅ 3 Command Used

```bash
python3 ~/scripts/send_and_log_sil_message.py \
  /tmp/test_payload.yml \
  --auto-timestamp \
  --fallback
```

**Dry run preview also tested successfully.**

---

### ⚠️ **Issue: Routing Log Write Failed**

Despite successful fallback + message preview behavior, `routing_log.yml` was **not updated**.

Expected path:  
`~/fieldlight_core/04_infrastructure/mesh/logs/routing_log.yml`

Observed behavior:

- No error thrown
    
- Log headers present
    
- Manual entry from 8/4 still present
    
- Suspected overwrite failure or file mode mismatch
    

---

### 🧪 **Troubleshooting Attempts**

|Attempt|Result|
|---|---|
|Verified log path in script|✅ Path corrected + hardcoded|
|Forced append mode in script|✅ Still no result|
|Tested on empty log|⚠️ Not attempted (TBD)|
|Used `log: true` in message/payload|✅ Preserved but no effect|
|Added print debug messages|✅ Output stops before log|

---

### 🧩 **Notable Observation**

- A second copy of the routing log briefly appeared with no headers and a single line from a past date (8/5), then vanished.
    
- May indicate confusion in file loading/syncing or race condition with editor buffers.
    

---

### ✅ Current Status

- **Message send logic:** ✅ Working
    
- **Timestamp injection:** ✅ Working
    
- **Fallback save:** ✅ Working
    
- **Routing log:** ❌ Not writing
    
- **Cause:** Unknown (suspected append conflict or parse mismatch)
    

---

### 🔁 Next Steps

- Create separate log test stub (`routing_log_test.yml`) to debug log behavior in isolation
    
- Consider logging helper script (or batch mode writer) to wrap append handling
    
- Migrate log config out to `logging_reference.yml` for reuse
    

---

### ✅ Result

You now have a functioning SIL message sender with timestamping and fallback logic. While routing log behavior failed, the outbound send test is confirmed and repeatable. Logging layer will be refactored in Step 2.
