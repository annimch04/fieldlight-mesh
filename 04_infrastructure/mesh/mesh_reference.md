## 🧠 What does a person or AI get access to once the daemon accepts a connection?

When a libp2p **daemon** (like `p2pd`) is running and **accepts a connection**, the connecting party gets access to:

### 🔓 1. **Transport Layer (P2P Networking)**

They can send/receive messages using libp2p streams over whatever protocol you've enabled (TCP, QUIC, etc.).

### 🔐 2. **Protocol Streams (if registered)**

If the daemon has handlers for specific protocols (e.g. echo, pubsub, gossipsub, or your own), then the peer can:

- Initiate a stream with that protocol
    
- Send messages (plaintext unless encrypted)
    
- Receive whatever the handler responds with
    

For example:

- If `--echo` is enabled (it is by default), anyone who connects can open an `/echo/1.0.0` stream and get back whatever they send.
    

### 💬 3. **Daemon Control Interface**

Only _you_ (via gRPC) can use the control socket (`/tmp/p2pd.sock`). External peers never touch that. But once you open a stream to them via the control layer, they can reply back. So:

- External peer → connects to public IP
    
- You (via Python) → create a stream to that peer
    
- Then data can flow both ways
    

### 🚫 What they **don’t** get automatically:

- File access
    
- Vault data
    
- Control socket (`/unix/tmp/p2pd.sock`)
    
- GPG keys or any access to system internals
    

Unless you code a protocol that _does_ that (e.g. serve vault files), none of that is exposed. You define the surface.

# Security Notes
Yes — **you absolutely should be aware of what exposure port 4001 creates**, especially since it’s now:

- Listening on **all interfaces** (`0.0.0.0`)
    
- **Publicly announced** via your real IP (`/ip4/162.246.134.48/tcp/4001`)
    
- **Allowed through UFW** for both IPv4 and IPv6
    
- Running **p2pd**, which can open multiplexed streams if paired with a client

### 🔍 So what are the actual risks?

#### 🧱 Minimal if:

- You’re **not running a stream handler** that parses messages
    
- Your system doesn’t allow untrusted users to run clients that connect to p2pd
    
- You’re only using it for **local dev/testing** (not a production mesh yet)
    

#### ⚠️ But potentially risky if:

- You leave it running unattended while connected to the internet
    
- You start exposing stream logic that reads or executes received data
    
- You add sensitive endpoints or services without locking down peers
    
- You plan to use it in mesh mode where actual traffic routing occurs

### 🔒 Recommended Precautions (you can choose):

#### ✅ Short-Term (Safer Dev Mode)

- Change `--listen` to only bind to localhost:
    
    ```bash
    ./p2pd --listen /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001
    ```
    
- Keep `--announceAddrs` as your public IP **if** you want to appear reachable to others — but they won’t be able to connect unless you expose the socket again.
    
- OR: use `ufw` to restrict access to **only localhost** or a specific dev IP.
    

#### ✅ Long-Term (Production-Ready Node)

- Define **allowlists** for peer IDs or IPs
    
- Use **mutual authentication** (e.g. pubkey/GPG or signed peer exchanges)
    
- Run behind **nginx reverse proxy**, VPN, or encrypted overlay
    
- Write a **daemon wrapper** that validates input, drops invalid streams, logs abnormal attempts
    

---

### If you want to lock it back down right now:

#### 1. Kill and restart p2pd with local-only bind:

```bash
./p2pd --listen /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4001 --announceAddrs /ip4/162.246.134.48/tcp/4001
```

#### 2. Restrict UFW to local only (optional safety net):

```bash
sudo ufw deny in on eth0 to any port 4001 proto tcp
```

Let me know if you want me to script any of that for Lemur or add a `security_notes.md`.
